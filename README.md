# saltation_microplastic

Codes and data for the analysis of experimental tests on the bed load saltation motion of spherical microplastic particles

Author: James Lofty

This repository includes the following :

data
- all results from microplastic and amber saltation experimental tests as average values  

example trajcetcory 
- video of a 5mm spherical PA microplastic saltating on a 1.86mm sediment bed at u*  = 0.0221
- corresponding coordinates of PA microplastic 

scripts
- R script for the characterising the trajectory and collision charateristcs of spherical microplastic particles based on coordinates (x,y) generated from a high speed camera extracted from the example video

microplastic_saltation R project 
- project file for the R analysis

config
